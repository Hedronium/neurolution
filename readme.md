# Introduction

Neurolution is a simulation of cars controlled by neural networks, which evolves to learn to drive.

# Overview

- The simulation is web-based that runs on a browser.
- Much of the code is written in Typescript.
- Phaser 3 is used as a game engine.
- Box2D powers the physics engine.
- Network network engine powers each car.
- Network networks evolve through generations, instead of other training methods such as stochastic gradient descent.

# Why TypeScript?

JavaScript doesn't support static typing. Moreover, a standardized JavaScript code is generated by the TypeScript compiler, and most errors are caught at compile-time instead of run-time.

# Why Phaser 3?

[Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) is used as a game engine, which is required for setting up and controlling the scene of the simulation. It basically provides a framework for the simulation which would be much more troublesome with vanilla JavaScript.

# Why Box2D?

[Box2D](https://box2d.org/) is the legendary physics engine, which was found in almost every single physics game on the web, back in the good old days when Adobe Flash used to rule the web.

Here, it's used mainly for collision detection, and proximity calculation; especially using techniques like [ray casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting).

# Directory Structure

> Directories are in bold, while files are italicized.

- **assets** - Contains all the sprites and resource associated with the simulation.
- **src**
	- **libs**
		- **common** - Contains scripts required by other libs.
		- **neural_network** - Represents the entire neural network associated stuff, including evolution.
		- **phaser** - Everything related to the game engine's (Phaser 3) preload, setup, creation, update, etc.
		- **simulation** - Holds code related to the simulation, such as the car, road tracks, etc.

- **static**
	- **js** - All the JavaScript scripts, such as that generated after compiling all the TypeScript files, and external libraries such as Box2D.

- *index.js* - A node.js script which simply serves *index.html* in a server.
- *index.html* - Webpage where the entire simulation is hosted.
- *tsconfig.json* - TypeScript config file, which holds the location[s] of the TypeScript scripts, where to save the resultant JavaScript script, and other attributes.
